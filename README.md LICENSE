This is a fully offline, beginner‑friendly Android app that provides smart, on‑device responses without any network or internet dependency. It supports multiple helpers including:
•⁠  ⁠Study Assistant (study plans, exam tips)
•⁠  ⁠Business Helper (simple business guidance)
•⁠  ⁠Motivation & Goal Planner (daily action steps)

Chat history persists across configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation). The app is designed for students, non‑technical users, and rural / semi‑urban audiences. The repository includes the complete Android Studio project with a modern Material UI, rule‑based offline AI logic, and simple build instructions.

Perfect for learning, local distribution, and small‑scale deployment with easy customization.
